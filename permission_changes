When I went to request the commit, git asked me to configure name and email in the environment, so I did it as usual.

When I researched the issue, I discovered that there is a default configuration in Windows that automatically makes changes to file permissions, and there is a git command that prevents git from tracking these permission changes, which is the following command :

git config --global core.FileMode false

"When core.fileMode is set to true, Git tracks changes in executable bits of files, 
which is the default behavior. By setting core.fileMode to false, you instruct Git to 
ignore changes in the file permissions. This means that changes like making a file 
executable or changing its read/write permissions won't be considered as changes by Git. 
This can prevent a lot of "noise" in Git commits and status, especially in environments 
where these permission changes are frequent and irrelevant to the project needs "
